# Uber-Trip-Analysis-looker
In this project, I worked on performing data analytics on Uber data using various tools and technologies, including Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Python, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio. The goal was to analyze and gain insights from the Uber dataset by implementing a modern data engineering pipeline.
